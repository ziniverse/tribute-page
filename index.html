        <p id="tribute-info"><bold>Here's a short paragraph on Hedy Lamarr's life and achievments:</bold></p>
        <p id="tribute-text">Hedy Lamarr, born in Vienna in 1914, led a life marked by remarkable achievements in both the realms of Hollywood glamour and technological innovation. As a renowned actress during the Golden Age of Hollywood, she captured the hearts of audiences with her beauty and talent in films like "Algiers" and "Samson and Delilah." However, Lamarr's brilliance extended far beyond the silver screen. During World War II, she collaborated with inventor George Antheil to pioneer the groundbreaking technology of frequency-hopping spread spectrum, a secure radio communication system that would lay the foundation for modern wireless technologies like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Despite her invention's significance, her contributions to science remained relatively unknown during her lifetime. Today, Hedy Lamarr stands as a symbol of the extraordinary potential that exists when creativity and intelligence unite, leaving an indelible mark on both the worlds of entertainment and technology.</p>
